I created a breakout game where 18 points must be scored by hitting tiles with a ball while controlling a paddle. 3 lives are given and a life is lost when the pall passes out of the scene. I additionally included a game over screen when all lives are lost and a you win screen when all tiles are broken. I also put in images to represent lives and points.
